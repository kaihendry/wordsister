# [WORD SISTER](https://github.com/kaihendry/wordsister)

My sister needed a simple Web page to add Wedding information upon. The options
sucked, so I wrote this.

## Features

Very low <abbr title="Source lines of code">SLOC</abbr>. [Suck less](http://suckless.org/) inspired.

[HTML](http://whatwg.org/html) isn't hard, though it's easier to edit with Markdown
with a [preview](http://markdown.pioul.fr/).

Editing a page on the Web is accomplished by appending <a href="/edit">/edit</a> to the URL.

You can also edit the `*.mdwn` directly on the filesystem. Just run `make` in the top level directory when done.

First HTML comment becomes the page title.

There is a simple text area to edit the <a href="/style.css">style.css</a> and
an ability to upload files.

# Authorising editing

First to <a href="/edit">/edit</a> gets a random **secret cookie id** for
authorising edits on the wiki. To give or restore edit rights, share the cookie
like so:

	echo http://$vhost/edit/?wordsister=$(ls cookies/)

## Optional: Edit the site remotely via git

	cat <<HERE > .git/hooks/post-receive
	#!/bin/sh
	export GIT_WORK_TREE=$(dirname $(pwd))
	if ! git diff --quiet
	then
		echo WORDSISTER on $GIT_WORK_TREE: Local changes detected. Will NOT be running make!
		echo WORDSISTER: Commit them on the remote host and git pull to do a merge.
		exit 1
	fi
	git checkout -f master
	cd ..
	make
	HERE
	chmod +x .git/hooks/post-receive
	git config receive.denyCurrentBranch ignore

On your local machine, you should be able to `git clone $vhost:/srv/www/$vhost`, make edits and `git push` back to the remote.
